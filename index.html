<p>To optimize the stability quality function, we use the Louvain algorithm as

of the program:</p>

<a name="contributions-to-the-code" class="anchor" href="#contributions-to-the-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributions to the code</h2>

<p>The C++ code performing the stability optimization is based on the 
implementation of the Louvain method as available from 
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/">http://sites.google.com/site/findcommunities/</a> 
(Authors: Jean-Loup Guillaume / Etienne Lefebvre)</p>

<p>The Louvain code was adapted and extended by R. Lambiotte 
(<a href="http://www.lambiotte.be">http://www.lambiotte.be</a>) to allow for the optimization of the stability quality 
function and was subsequently refined further by Antoine Delmotte. </p>

<p>The MATLAB frontend was initally added by Antoine Delmotte. 
Version 2.0 which updates the first release and includes the addition of 
directed stability was created by Michael Schaub. 
Final adjustments and additions, testing, and maintenance are due to 
Antoine Delmotte and Michael Schaub.</p>

<a name="how-to-install-the-stability-package" class="anchor" href="#how-to-install-the-stability-package"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to install the stability package</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Open Matlab</p></li>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed</p>

<ul>
<li>For Linux, you can find one here: 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/</a>
</li>
<li>For Windows, you can use Visual C++ express: 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/">http://www.microsoft.com/express/Windows/</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure mex is properly configured in Matlab:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type "mex -setup" in Matlab, and choose your compiler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In Matlab, go into the directory of the Stability toolbox.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Type "Install_Stability" in the Matlab command window.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If you get an error message concerning the libstdc++.so file, 
you may want to try the following manipulation:</p>

<pre><code>cd "Matlab_root_directory"/sys/os/glnx86/
sudo mv libgcc_s.so.1 libgcc_s.so.1.back
sudo mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6.back
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You will get a messge asking whether the stability toolbox should 
be added to your Matlab path. Answering yes will allow you to use 
the stability toolbox functions as standard Matlab functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Type "help stability" in Matlab to discover how to use the code.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Try this example to check that everything is working:</p>

<pre><code>cd('demo');   % go into the demo directory (in the stability folder)
load demo;    % load data and then run stability
[S, N, VI, C] = stability(Graph,Time,'plot','v');
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol><p>NOTES:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The install script provides the option to add the bin folder to your 
Matlab path. This will enable you to use stability as a standard Matlab 
function from any directory. If you don't want this option any more,
just remove it from the path by going in File/Set Path.</p></li>
<li><p>If you get a warning message concerning savepath, and you want the 
stability code to be in your path, go, after the installation, in 
File/Set Path, and choose "save". Then choose where you want pathdef.m
to be saved. If at the next matlab startup, you notice that stability is
not in your matlab path anymore, try editing/creating the "startup.m" file
from your matlab user folder (type userpath to know where it is located)
and add the following line: addpath(' path to bin folder of stability 
package '). Alternatively, if you are the only user on your machine, you
can start matlab as a superuser ("sudo matlab" in linux) and rerun the
"Install_Stability" script. This will permanently add the stability folder 
in the path for all users.</p></li>
<li>
<p>To speed up the calculations, you might consider adding the
option 'noVI'. This disables the calculation of the variation of information, 
which is usually slow at small Markov times, when the number of 
communities found is big. 
Another option is to decrease the number of optimisations on which the variation 
of information is calculated. To do so, add the option 'M' and put a value
such that M &lt; L (L is the number of louvain optimisations).<br>
Example:</p>

<p>[S, N, VI, C] = stability(Graph,time,'plot','v', 'L', 100, 'M', 10);</p>
